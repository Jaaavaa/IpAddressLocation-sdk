# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

## Basic Guidelines

### Use an IDE.
Specifically, IntelliJ IDEA. Download the (free) Community Edition of it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). Some people use other tools, like VS Code, but I would personally not recommend them for Java development.

### Always test your changes.
Do not submit something without at least running the game to see if it compiles.  
If you are submitting a new block, make sure it has a name and description, and that it works correctly in-game. If you are changing existing block mechanics, test them out first.

### Do not make formatting PRs.
It seems there are some minor formatting issues like trailing spaces, extra newlines, and empty indents. It would appreciate it if you could take a moment to address these. However, please refrain from sending one-line PRs just for formatting fixes. If you're making substantial code changes, feel free to tidy up the formatting around your modifications. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
